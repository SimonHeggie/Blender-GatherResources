# Blender-GatherResources
Collect/Assemble/Gather all resources to the texture child directory. AKA: 'GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.'

Early testing has begun.

WARNING: AS IN, NO TESTING HAS BEEN DONE YET. I REPEAT. NO TESTING HAS BEEN DONE!

TEST AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

## Installation:

For now, grab the PY file and copy and paste it into your text editor in Blender, save it in the blend file. Run the script to activate it.

## Usage:

File > External Data > Gather Resources: 

This should in theory take all resources used within your project and relocate them to your child texture directory.

## BUGS:

This is going to be full of bugs, so any testing is apreciated.

#### 1. Summary of the Issue

What’s not working? (E.g., "File links are not updating to the new 'textures' folder.")
What did you expect to happen? (E.g., "The script should copy files to the 'textures' folder and update the paths to relative links.")

#### 2. Steps to Reproduce the Issue

Provide a step-by-step guide to reproduce the problem:

Open Blender [Version Number].
Set up a scene with videos, images, sounds, or Alembic caches.
Run the Gather Resources script.
Check if all files were copied to the textures/ folder and paths were correctly updated.

#### 3. Expected vs. Actual Behavior
Expected Behavior: (E.g., "Files should be copied to the 'textures' folder, and their paths updated to relative links.")
Actual Behavior: (E.g., "Files remained in their original location, or the paths were not updated.")

#### 4. System Information
Operating System: (E.g., Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13)
CPU: (E.g., Intel Core i9-13900HX)
GPU: (E.g., NVIDIA RTX 4070)
RAM: (E.g., 32GB)
Blender Version: (E.g., 4.0.1, 3.6.5)
5. Files and Formats Involved
Were all file types handled correctly?
(E.g., "The script copied image files, but skipped .abc files.")
Relevant Formats in Use: (Check all that apply)
 Video (.mp4, .mkv, etc.)
 Image (.png, .jpg, etc.)
 Audio (.wav, .mp3, etc.)
 Alembic (.abc)
 3D Models (.fbx, .obj, etc.)

#### 6. Error Messages or Console Output
Were there any errors? (If yes, provide the exact error message or attach a screenshot of the console output.)

#### 7. Workarounds or Attempts to Fix (If Any)
What have you tried so far? (E.g., “Tried running the script on a fresh project, but the issue persists.”)

#### 8. Additional Context or Observations
How often does the issue occur? (E.g., Every time, or intermittently?)
Is this project-specific? (Does the problem happen in only one project or across multiple?)

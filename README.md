Collect/Assemble/Gather all resources to the texture child directory. AKA: 'GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.'

<img src="GatherResources.png">

Early testing has begun.

I have tested a couple of scenarios, but TEST AT YOUR OWN PERIL.... Be sure to test it on something that you don't mind destroying. 


## Installation:

Download from here: https://github.com/SimonHeggie/Blender-GatherResources/archive/refs/heads/main.zip (DO NOT UNZIP)

In blender: Edit/Preferences/Add-ons... Top right arrow, 'Install from Disk'. Select the Gather Resources zip file, then tick it to activate.

## Usage:

File > External Data > Gather Resources: 

This will take all resources used within your project and relocate them to your child texture directory.

## BUGS:

This is going to be full of bugs, so any testing is apreciated.

#### 1. Summary of the Issue

What’s not working? (E.g., "File links are not updating to the new 'textures' folder.")

#### 2. Steps to Reproduce the Issue

Provide a step-by-step guide to reproduce the problem:

Open Blender [Version Number].
Set up a scene with videos, images, sounds, or Alembic caches.
Run the Gather Resources script.
Check if all files were copied to the textures/ folder and paths were correctly updated.

#### 3. Expected vs. Actual Behavior
Expected Behavior: (E.g., "Files should be copied to the 'textures' folder, and their paths updated to relative links.")
Actual Behavior: (E.g., "Files remained in their original location, or the paths were not updated.")

#### 4. System Information


Operating System: (E.g., Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13)
CPU: (E.g., Intel Core i9-13900HX)

What have you tried so far? (E.g., “Tried running the script on a fresh project, but the issue persists.”)

#### 8. Additional Context or Observations
How often does the issue occur? (E.g., Every time, or intermittently?)
Is this project-specific? (Does the problem happen in only one project or across multiple?)
